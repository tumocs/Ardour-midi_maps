# Ardour-midi_maps
Very basic Arturia beatstep control script for ardour.

1. Flash ardour.beatstep to your controller (you'll need Windows or OSX to do this, vm is fine).
2. Copy beatstep.map to ~/.config/ardour(version_number)/midi_maps/ or where ever you happen to have them.
3. Enjoy mixing.

Usage:
Channel 1 controls tracks 1-8
First row of knobs is for gain
Second row of knobs controls panning direction
First row of pads toggles Solo
Second row is for Mute
Big knob for master
Change to channel 2 to control tracks 9-16
